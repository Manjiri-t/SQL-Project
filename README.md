# Data Extraction using SQL  
          





**Goal:**
    The goal was to analyze large-scale datasets from two different domains—Airline bookings and Bike Sharing usage—to extract meaningful insights for operational and strategic decisions.
    Design and execute optimized SQL queries to efficiently retrieve, filter, and summarize high-volume data across multiple relational tables.

  **Descriptions:**
  Wrote complex SQL queries involving multi-table joins, subqueries, and aggregations (GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT, SUM, etc.). Applied WHERE, CASE, and window functions to slice data by date, location, and customer segments.Focused on query optimization techniques by using indexes, subquery refactoring, and LIMIT/OFFSET to improve performance. Ensured data accuracy and relevance by applying conditional logic and validating output against sample checkpoints.

  **Result:**
  Delivered clean, well-structured datasets that revealed trends in booking behaviors, peak travel times, and user preferences in bike-sharing, helping to shape operational planning and strategic analysis.

  **Technology:**
     SQL (Structured Query Language)

  **Skills:**
  Data Analysis Techniques, Data cleaning and validation,
  Query optimization using indexes, EXPLAIN plans, Problem-Solving & Logic Building
